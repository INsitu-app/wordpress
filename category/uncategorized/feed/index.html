										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I, Harmeet,&nbsp; have had the pleasure of meeting Edward and Insitu through <a href="https://www.airhorse.co.uk/estate-agent-leicester/">Airhorse property Management</a> where I now write this guest blog sharing insights on Augmented Reality (AR).&nbsp; In the 2 years, me and Edward have had the pleasure of working together where I have learnt about AR technology and implemented it for my business. <br><br>Given that Insitu have been around for over half a decade now, <a href="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/">INsitu</a> has been creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality</a> (AR) solutions before the term was even popular.</p>



<p>On face value, AR technology allows you to place an object in your current or provided environment, digitally. In popular culture, AR has more recently become widely recognisable since <a href="https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/">Pokémon Go</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Our Specialism</strong></h3>



<p>Initially, INsitu developed big building projects using Augmented Reality. Then, while watching <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006vq92">Dragon’s Den</a>, where a participant was selling garden rooms, the garden room niche was selected for its practicality and potential demand. Given that creating a garden room can be an expensive investment; one that can not be altered very easily after execution, our niching makes sense.</p>



<p>As a result, consumers of INsitu’s partners are now prepared to outlay the cost because of being able to see how their garden would look after implementation.</p>



<p>However, this is not the end of their idea.<br></p>



<h3><strong>The Human Psychology Element</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KLeeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=visualisation+has+always+been+an+integral+part+of+our+decision+making+process&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kiUWSjurA2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2UvP1eF46qf74UTQdlWXjwtDAbww">Visualisation</a> has always been an integral part of INsitu’s decision making process.</p>



<p>In fact, it becomes a challenge to purchase when the consumer is not able to visualise the potential outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are instances of the inverse. For instance, individuals who have a natural, creative eye may be able to visualise independently. Or, on the other hand, those who are willing to take a risk, usually the more <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/understanding-early-adopters-and-customer-adoption-patterns">averse</a> among us who are more likely to be early adopters too, are the ones who may not require AR. However, for most of us who like to see before they buy, AR is a great plus.</p>



<p>In the past, most of us would have had to physically visit or take our chances before purchasing an item. Given that physical checking is not always an option and taking your chances can lead to financial disasters, AR solves a market challenge viably.</p>



<p>Put simply, in order for consumers to be able to purchase a product, they will feel more comfortable knowing what they will be getting through AR.</p>



<p>Now, let’s look into a few other options for the application of AR.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Application of AR</strong></h3>



<p>It goes without saying that there are multiple ways in which AR can be used. Here are a few:</p>



<ul><li>Property – Building structures and the scenic difference with the construction of a new development. This can also be useful for planning permission.</li><li>Interior Design – How a room would look after a refurbishment</li><li>Gaming – The possibilities are endless</li><li>Sales – Technology can be a tool to brand your business. <a href="http://www.mvcaccountants.co.uk">Accountants in Leicester</a> are using Augmented Reality to present their accounting and financial services to clients, bringing fun to what might have been traditional boring.</li><li>Vehicles – <a href="https://omcglobal.co.uk/milton-keynes/minibus-hire/">Luxury vehicles</a> are having to do more to showcase their products. The opportunity to experience a vehicle without having to leave your driveway is quite tasty.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was <strong>great moment to be from Leicester Last night</strong>:<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlqVSHiq058" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
Having just won the barclays premier league the fans partied through the night. One particular fan, partied very hard indeed:<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shirtless.gif" alt="shirtless" width="480" height="270" /><br />
He started <strong>banging triumphantly</strong> on booth &#8211; and rightly so to!!!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/banging.gif" alt="banging" width="480" height="270" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
It&#8217;s a very <strong>modular looking building</strong> and seeing as it took a <strong>good old pounding</strong>, i couldn&#8217;t help imagining what a <strong>new modern timber clad</strong>  building would look like instead:<br />
<figure id="attachment_794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-794" style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-794" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/canvas-2.jpg" alt="the awning window would make a nice hatch to for dispensing tickets??" width="922" height="692" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/canvas-2.jpg 922w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/canvas-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/canvas-2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-794" class="wp-caption-text">the awning window would make a nice hatch to for dispensing tickets??</figcaption></figure><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We want to <strong>assimilate</strong> buildings into their <strong>context</strong> as realistically as possible. Glass reflects it&#8217;s surrounding environment, blurring the lines between what is real and what is rendered.

Blending the building into the environment doesn&#8217;t stop with the glass. What about inside, through the glass &#8211; the interior.  As you can see from the animation below, the interior shading doesn&#8217;t correlate with the intensity of the shadow<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>right at the begining we decided that <a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/insitu-is-a-platform/">INsitu was to be a platform</a>. Not only can you visualise modular buildings in-situ, but all outdoor products. We have worked closely with cedar nursery, helping their customers see a large range of their products, in their gardens, from louvred pergolas to garden benches and planters.<br />
Now we&#8217;re exploring the possibility of paving. With this particular range of paving there is a strong demand to &#8220;see before you buy&#8221;  so lets see how INsitu can help.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">creating the paving</span><br />
currently INsitu only deals with products that are of predefined sizes &#8211; eg modular buildings. As you can imagine the paving profile from one property to the next is completely different, so this stage will be completed manually. However, at a later stage; this is process can be automated and included in the app; so that users can do it themselves; In much the same way as shown below. Simply<strong> locate your property</strong> on google maps and <strong>trace the outline</strong> of where you&#8217;d like your paving to go. Imagine doing this on touch screen with your finger!<br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-profile.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-713"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-713" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-profile.gif" alt="paving profile" width="718" height="598" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">choose your paving</span><br />
Once you&#8217;ve created your paving, choose a style. I went with the first one<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1698.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-714"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-714" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1698-1024x181.jpg" alt="paving sample" width="900" height="159" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1698-1024x181.jpg 1024w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1698-300x53.jpg 300w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1698-768x136.jpg 768w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1698.jpg 1572w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/apply-texture-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-716"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-716" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/apply-texture-1-979x1024.jpg" alt="apply texture" width="900" height="941" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>take a photo</strong> of your where you&#8217;d like your paving to go and <strong>drop in-place</strong></span><br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-allign.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-718"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-allign.gif" alt="paving allign" width="513" height="684" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
don&#8217;t forget to save your finished render, so that you can easily retrieve later to discuss later with a  paving supplier<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-profile.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-720"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-720" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-profile.jpg" alt="paving profile" width="519" height="694" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-profile.jpg 519w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paving-profile-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>when you upload an image you&#8217;ll will notice a new icon, the sun icon:<br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1610.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-696"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-696" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1610.jpg" alt="sun icon" width="1846" height="1382" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1610.jpg 1846w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1610-300x225.jpg 300w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1610-768x575.jpg 768w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/snap-and-drag_1610-1024x767.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1846px) 100vw, 1846px" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
In most cases INsitu will be able to accurately <strong>simulate</strong> the<strong> suns position in the sky</strong>, so you&#8217;ll then be able to control the intensity:<br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/resized-sun-shadows-with-watermark.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-695"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/resized-sun-shadows-with-watermark.gif" alt="resized sun shadows with watermark" width="512" height="512" /></a><br />
Sometimes, INsitu needs a helping hand; which is where you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Angle</strong> to control the horizontal position &#8211; think sunrise to sunset</li>
<li><strong>Height</strong> to control how high the sun is in the sky &#8211; think months of the year</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to <strong>innovate</strong> and <strong>explore new markets?</strong> Would you like to <strong>sell more of your products</strong>? If so our friends at the <a href="http://www.farmbusinessshow.co.uk/">Farm Business Innovation Show</a> (FBIS) help open up suppliers to new opportunities and partners. How? they provide landowners with exciting new opportunities and ways to develop their land<br />
<em>the following is a case study, which is in progress, so details have been kept confidential. </em><br />
a supplier contacted FBIS looking for ways to be <strong>introduced to landowners, </strong>who are looking to<strong> develop their land</strong>. Laura and the team got in touch with developers who were <strong>looking for something a bit different</strong>. One such developer was looking to build on their success of opening several glamping resorts. This year they wanted to diversify the range of accommodation, with luxury holiday villas. The supplier was an experienced seller of luxury garden offices and annexes so was excited to take on the work &#8211; they&#8217;d be selling not just one, <strong>but a dozen</strong> to<strong> fill the resort</strong>. However, this was not a done deal: the supplier had to not only <strong>convince the developers</strong>, but the <strong>local planning authority</strong>. It&#8217;s a good job Laura had previously reached out to us because now there was an exciting opportunity for us to work together.  We worked with the supplier, loading their design into our app and produced the following proposed visual<br />

previously,  we demonstrated INsitu realistically rendering the users environment. Having gone to alot of hardwork, simulating lighting and atmospheric conditions, we wanted to ensure that the 3D models <strong>showcased this</strong>. We focussed on making the materials more realistic &#8211; manipulating their parameters &#8211; so that they respond to the environment.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">material relief &#8211; bump mapping</span><br />
Materials in real life are not completely flat, especially timber cladding &#8211; the grooves in the wood are inset from the surface<br />
below is a quick before and after<br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bump.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-261" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bump.jpg" alt="bump" width="2564" height="1048" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bump.jpg 2564w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bump-300x123.jpg 300w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bump-768x314.jpg 768w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bump-1024x419.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2564px) 100vw, 2564px" /></a><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">specular reflection</span><br />
<a href="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/specular-refelctions-on-the-stone-floor-2.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-265" src="http://www.insitu-app.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/specular-refelctions-on-the-stone-floor-2.gif" alt="specular refelctions on the stone floor 2" width="648" height="266" /></a><br />
as you observe a shiny/reflective surface from different angles, you will notice how the light bouncing off it changes. This is what happens in real life, and we wanted to simulate it.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">reflections</span><br />
The glass we had before was a partly transparent material, but that was it: it left alot to be desired to truly represent glass. We&#8217;ve added reflections&#8230;..look carefully and you&#8217;ll notice the branches of the trees <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>you&#8217;ll notice the <a href="https://insituapp.wordpress.com/2015/05/17/screen-shots-from-our-beta-app-launch/">previous renders we created</a>, displayed the garden room a fare distance away. However our early adopters who&#8217;ve tested our app <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> have been producing renders where the model is within a closer range. This is great feedback, that we&#8217;ve had to adjust to, as the perspective needs to be improved with such renders<a href="https://insituapp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/perpsective-wrong.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="https://insituapp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/perpsective-wrong.jpg" alt="perpsective - wrong" width="660" height="497" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-wrong.jpg 1858w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-wrong-300x226.jpg 300w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-wrong-768x579.jpg 768w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-wrong-1024x772.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><br />
you can see it clearly doesn&#8217;t line up with boundary of the service box &#8211; which is its perimeter. The problem can be resolved by including a sketchup-like &#8220;look around&#8221;  tool which will be included in the next release.<br />
<a href="https://insituapp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/perpsective-correct.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49" src="https://insituapp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/perpsective-correct.jpg" alt="perpsective - correct" width="660" height="522" srcset="https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-correct.jpg 1836w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-correct-300x237.jpg 300w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-correct-768x607.jpg 768w, https://INsitu-app.github.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/perpsective-correct-1024x810.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a><br />
the additional benefit of this tool is it&#8217;ll require less manually positioning once used</p>
